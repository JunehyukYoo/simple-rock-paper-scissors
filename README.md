# simple-rock-paper-scissors

A simple game of rock-paper-scissors to brush up on my Javascript. 
Five rounds are played, with a draw resulting in no points and a win resulting in one point.
If the human has more points by the end of the five rounds, the human wins!
The game is played directly in the developer console.
