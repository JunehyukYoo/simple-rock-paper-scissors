# simple-rock-paper-scissors

A simple game of rock-paper-scissors to brush up on my Javascript. 
Five rounds are played, with a draw resulting in no points and a win resulting in one point.
If the human has more points by the end of the five rounds, the human wins!
The game is played directly in the developer console. 

Patch 1.0 : Added UI and removed console logging. The game is now only playable in the browser.
